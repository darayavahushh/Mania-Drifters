# Mania-Drifters

### Mania Drifters is an Android game developed by a small and slick team called Mobileverse. 

The game involves [drifting, drifting and more drifting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9-voINFkCg) around an unbelievable beautiful scenery with different kinds of obstacles. The game tries to bring together car loversâ€™ community under the same screen. We got a choice for everyone:
  - classic enthusiasts
  - muscle cars 
  - JDMs 
  - sport cars
  - vans

Just pick a car, select a map and go burn those tires to the ground!
